INTRODUCTION: BACKEND/API
------------

* This program's backend is built with Python.

* To generate random short URL's, a variable called saved_link is defined as: "".join([random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits) for _ in range(10)])

- This algorithm takes advantage of Python's native random and string libraries.

* To prevent duplicate links, the backend performs a database search for duplicate links. If a duplicate exists, it enters a while loop, re-rolling random links, until a unique link is generated. Though the odds of this happening are 62^10, it's always better to verify.

* To clone this repository and have a look at the code:

 1. Navigate in your preferred terminal (Windows: Command Prompt, PowerShell Linux: Bash Mac: Terminal) to the directory you would like to clone my repository to. You'll be downloading a set of files.

 2. When you're at the proper directory, run the following command:

      $ gh repo clone Subliminal-Panda/postgres-url-shortener-backend

* If you want to run this app entirely on your own computer, you'll have to follow the steps toward the bottom, under CLONING AND RUNNING THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY as well as CLONING AND RUNNING THE BACKEND REPOSITORY.

INTRODUCTION: USING THE APP
------------

* This program is reasonably user-friendly, so it shouldn't be too tough to dive right in!

* I recommend running it inside codesandbox for the sake of simplicity. To get to it (if you're not in codesandbox already) navigate to the following URL:

https://codesandbox.io/s/beautiful-noyce-j499o?

*If you'd like to try this application outside codesandbox, skip down to CLONING AND RUNNING THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY.

* To enter a URL, click the input field titled "Enter a new URL:" and enter your desired destination URL.

* It doesn't matter if it starts with a prefix of http://, https://, www., or even no prefix whatsoever! just make sure the URL is spelled correctly.

* If you would like to create your own custom short link, enter your desired link name in the "Custom short link (optional): input field. You can use spaces and special characters. Just keep in mind, if you write a short link that isn't short, it will overflow the display area. (It will still work, it just won't look very pretty.)

* Click the green "Submit Url" button. The backend will automatically recognize whether you've created a custom short link. If not, it will generate a random 10 character link instead.

* It might take just a moment to update the list with your new URL and Short Link (free databases are prioritized last... sad.)

* Once your link appears, you can click either the URL itself (to the left) or the short link (on the right) to visit the URL you entered! It's magical!

* To delete a URL and its corresponding Short Link, just click the pink/red "Delete Link" button to the right, on the same row.

REQUIREMENTS: CODE SANDBOX
------------

* This module (in codesandbox) requires the following dependencies, which should be pre-loaded:

 - react
 - react-dom
 - react-scripts

CLONING AND RUNNING THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY
------------

* If you'd like to try this application outside codesandbox:

 1. Navigate in your preferred terminal (Windows: Command Prompt, PowerShell Linux: Bash Mac: Terminal) to the directory you would like to clone my repository to. You'll be downloading a set of files.

 2. When you're at the proper directory, run the following command:

      $ gh repo clone Subliminal-Panda/postgres-url-shortener-frontend

 3. If you don't have npm already, install it at the following link:

 https://github.com/npm/npm/archive/refs/tags/v5.2.0.zip

 4. You'll also need to install scss and sass via npm. Once you've got npm, run the following commands in your terminal:

      $ npm install sass
      $ npm install compile-sass

 5. Then run it:

      $ npm start

*  That should do it! The backend is always running, so you don't need to do anything special for that. However, if you would like to run this entirely on your own machine (in a test environment) you'll have to do the following:

CLONING AND RUNNING THE BACKEND REPOSITORY
------------

  1. Install python, if you don't already have it:

      https://www.python.org/downloads/

  2. Clone the backend repository, if you haven't already- go to a directory where you're comfortable cloning an app, then run this in your terminal:

          $ gh repo clone Subliminal-Panda/postgres-url-shortener-backend

  3. Install PIP via the terminal, if you don't already have it:

          $ python -m ensurepip --upgrade

  4. Install Pipenv:

          $ pip install pipenv

  5. Enter a pipenv shell environment:

          $ pipenv shell

  6. Install the following dependencies within your pipenv shell environment:

          $ pipenv install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_marshmallow flask_cors psycopg2

  7. To change the db to your local environment, delete line 12 in app.py, and in its place, paste:

          app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///" + os.path.join(basedir, "app.sqlite")

  8. Start python:

          $ python

  9. Run the following commands using Python:

          > from app import db
          > db.create_all()

  10. If that doesn't return any errors, your test environment database is created! Now let's get it running:

          $ python app.py

  11. Alright, the backend is running on your local machine. Now, you'll have to change every endpoint in the frontend to wherever the database is running on your local machine. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in CLONING THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY.

  12. Now, in your cloned front-end repository, replace all instances of "https://tm-url-shortener-backend.herokuapp.com/" (yes, it's a lot, but you can use VS Code's search if you use Visual Studio Code.) replace them all with the location where the database is running on your computer. The terminal should say *Running on (Most likely it will be: "http://127.0.0.1:5000/").

  13. Alright, you've got a working backend and frontend running on your computer! Baddabing!
